## ברוכים הבאים לקורס של 🤗!

<Youtube id="00GKzGyWFEs" />

קורס זה ילמד אתכם על עיבוד שפה טבעית (NLP) בעזרת הספריות שמרכיבות את האקוסיסטם של [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) -
<span dir="ltr" align="right">
  ,[Transformers🤗](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) ,[Datasets🤗](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) ,[Tokenizers🤗](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) 
</span>
ו - [🤗Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) — כמו גם ה [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). זה חינמי לחלוטין ולא מכיל פרסומות.

## למה לצפות?

לפניכם סקירה קצרה של הקורס:

- פרקים 1 עד 4 מספקים מבוא לקונספטים העיקריים של ספריית הטרנספורמרים של 🤗. בסוף חלק זה של הקורס, תכירו כיצד מודלי טרנספורמרים פועלים ותדעו איך להשתמש במודל מה [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), לעשות fine-tune על דאטאסט ולחלוק את התוצאות ב Hub.
- פרקים 5 עד 8 מלמדים את הבסיס של דאטאסטים ו Tokenizers של 🤗 לפני שנצלול למשימות NLP קלאסיות. בסוף חלק זה, תוכלו להתמודד עם רוב בעיות ה NLP הנפוצות בעצמכם.
- פרקים 9 עד 12 מרחיבים על נושאים מעבר ל NLP, ומפרטים על איך מודלי טרנספורמר יכולים לשמש לפתרון בעיות  של speech processing ו computer vision. לאורך הדרך, תלמדו איך לבנות ולחלוק הדגמות של המודל ולהתאים אותם לסביבות פרודקשן. בסוף חלק זה תהיו מוכנים ליישם טרנספורמרים של 🤗 כמעט לכל בעיית machine learning.

קורס זה:

* מצריך ידע טוב ב Python
* עדיף שילקח לאחר קורס מבוא ללמידה עמוקה כמו : [fast.ai's](https://www.fast.ai/) [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) או אחד מהקורסים של [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
* לא מצפה לידע קודם ב [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) או [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) , אך היכרות מסויימת עם כל אחד מהם יכולה לסייע.

לאחר שתסיימו את הקורס הזה, אנחנו ממליצים לבדוק את [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing?utm_source=deeplearning-ai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=20211011-nlp-2-hugging_face-page-nlp-refresh) של DeepLearning.AI, שמכסה מגוון מודלי NLP מסורתיים כמו naive Bayes ו LSTM's ששווה להכיר!

## מי אנחנו?

על המחברים:
<span dir="rtl" align="right">

י**Matthew Carrigan** הוא Machine Learning Engineer ב Hugging Face. הוא מתגורר בדאבלין, אירלנד ובעבר עבד כ  ML engineer ב Parse.ly ולאחר מכן כפוסט-דוק ב  Trinity College Dublin. הוא לא מאמין שנגיע ל  AGI בעזרת scaling של ארכיטקטורות קיימות, אבל בעל תקוות גדולות לחיי נצח של רובוטים בכל זאת.

**Lysandre Debut** is a Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face and has been working on the 🤗 Transformers library since the very early development stages. His aim is to make NLP accessible for everyone by developing tools with a very simple API.

**Sylvain Gugger** is a Research Engineer at Hugging Face and one of the core maintainers of the 🤗 Transformers library. Previously he was a Research Scientist at fast.ai, and he co-wrote _[Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/)_ with Jeremy Howard. The main focus of his research is on making deep learning more accessible, by designing and improving techniques that allow models to train fast on limited resources.

**Merve Noyan** is a developer advocate at Hugging Face, working on developing tools and building content around them to democratize machine learning for everyone.

**Lucile Saulnier** is a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, developing and supporting the use of open source tools. She is also actively involved in many research projects in the field of Natural Language Processing such as collaborative training and BigScience.

**Lewis Tunstall**  is a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, focused on developing open-source tools and making them accessible to the wider community. He is also a co-author of an upcoming [O’Reilly book on Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/).

**Leandro von Werra**  is a machine learning engineer in the open-source team at Hugging Face and also a co-author of the an upcoming [O’Reilly book on Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/). He has several years of industry experience bringing NLP projects to production by working across the whole machine learning stack..
